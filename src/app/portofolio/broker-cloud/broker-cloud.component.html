        <h2 class="ci-heading">Overview</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project is a versatile and efficient system for managing
          plugins, integrating credentials, and facilitating interactions. It collects data on features, users,
          licenses, organizations, and user management.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service employs dynamic form generation, where the back-end
          provides fields and data types, and the front-end dynamically constructs forms and sends data as dynamic
          objects. Additionally, a generic mechanism handles the seamless sending, accessing, and encryption of
          credentials through reflections, eliminating hardcoded credentials and enhancing security.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: 500;"> Key Features</p>
