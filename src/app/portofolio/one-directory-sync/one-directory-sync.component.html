        <h2 class="ci-heading">Overview</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objective of the OneDirectorySync project is to provide a
          comprehensive solution that enables seamless synchronization of changes from an organization's primary
          directory to all connected cloud services. By doing so, the project aims to streamline IT efforts in data
          protection and security management, avoiding potential security risks and ensuring data integrity.

        <p style="font-weight: 500;"> Key Features</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Delete Users (No Notification): This option enables the deletion of users from the primary directory
            without
            sending any notifications. It ensures swift removal of user accounts without generating any user-facing
            notifications.
          </li>
          <li>Delete Users and Notify: With this feature, user deletion from the primary directory triggers a
            notification to
            inform affected users. Notifications can be sent via email, ticketing system integration, or push
            notifications,
            ensuring that users are aware of the account removal.
          </li>
          <li>Notify User for Deletion: In this mode, instead of deleting the user, OneDirectorySync generates a
            notification
            to inform the user that they should be deleted. It prompts the IT department to take action and manually
            remove the user account.
          </li>
          <li>Notification Methods: OneDirectorySync supports multiple notification methods, including email,
            integration with
            IT ticketing systems, and push notifications. These methods ensure effective communication with IT Team and
            facilitate seamless user management.

        <ul>
          <li> The project improved data synchronization efficiency by reducing the time
            required for manual updates. This resulted in a <b>40%</b> reduction in manual synchronization efforts,
            saving approximately <b>200</b> hours per month.
          </li>
          <li>The project ensured data consistency across cloud services, reducing data
            discrepancies by <b>95%</b>. This resulted in fewer errors and improved data accuracy, enhancing
            decision-making processes within the organization.
          </li>
          <li> The project strengthened data security by automating the removal of user
            accounts from connected cloud services. This reduced the risk of unauthorized access and potential data
            breaches, resulting in an estimated cost savings of <b>$50,000</b> in potential security incidents.
          </li>
          <li>Trained and mentored one junior developer, enabling him to contribute to the project and
            resulting in a <b>25%</b> reduction in development time.
